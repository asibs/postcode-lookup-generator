### Notes

This dataset maps every Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) - which represents an address in the UK - to a variety
of geographies, including westminster parliamentary constituency. Unfortunately, this dataset does not (yet) include
the "new" UK Parliamentary Constituency boundaries - it uses the "current" boundaries which will not be used in the
next general election in 2024 or 2025. It does include National Grid Reference co-ordinates for each address, which can
be converted to latitude/longitude to work out which new constituency the address falls within.
